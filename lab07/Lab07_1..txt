
a.

Exercise 1

cities['IsSaint'] = cities['City name'].apply(lambda val: val.startswith("San"))
cities['Greater50'] = cities['Area square miles'].apply(lambda val: val > 50)
cities['Exercise1'] = cities['IsSaint'] & cities['Greater50']
cities

Excercise 2

cities.reindex([0, 100, 300, 2])
This is probably allowed because it would be easier to implement other lists without having to worry about null errors.

b. Pandas does a lot of things under the hood that require a lot of operations otherwise. It's like how SQL alleviates the need to do lots of while loops and retreival functions.
c. Training data is shuffled for input to a neural network to re-test an agent. Pathological ordering effects can also harm the performance of an AI's gradient.
