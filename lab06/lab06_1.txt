Exercise 6.1

FRAMING---------------------------------------------------

What we want the ML to do:
To determine how threatening a person appears in an image.

Our ideal outcome:
For the algorithm to identify threatening images the same way that a human would. This could useful for content curation, especially for children.

Success metrics:
How close the algorithm's output is to a human's answer (AKA from a scale of 0 to 1 of how threatening a person appears to be)

Key Results:
Arriving at an answer that is less than .1 units away from the actual human response.

ML Model failure:
Arriving at an answer that is more than .1 units away from the actual human response.

ML output:
The image will produce a single number ranging from 0 to 1.

Output definition:
A scale, 0 being completely non-threatening, 1 being very threatening.

The output from the ML model will be made:
When the image is requested from a database.

The outcome will be used for:
A child filter for image searches.

If we didn't use ML?
We would have to use a human to hand-curate the images themselves.

FORMULATING---------------------------------------------------

Best Framed as:
Unidimensional regression, which predicts
a 1-dimensional scale that ranges from high to low
