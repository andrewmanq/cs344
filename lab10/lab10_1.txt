Questions:

    1. Would you rather use TensorFlow or Keras to build your models?

Just from a usability standpoint, keras is much easier to set up and quickly test. I prefer the flexibility of keras despite the lack of granular control. This makes sense considering that keras is a usabiliy interface for tensorflow.

    2. Tasks 1 & 2: Report your best hyper-parameter settings and their resulting performance on the testing dataset.

TASK1
------
dnn_regressor = train_nn_regression_model(
    learning_rate=0.001,
    steps=1600,
    batch_size=120,
    hidden_units=[10, 2],
    training_examples=training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

    RMSE -> 112.89

    TASK2
    ------
    result on test data -> 111.24
