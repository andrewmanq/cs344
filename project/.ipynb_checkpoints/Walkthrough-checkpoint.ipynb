    "# AI architect - walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing his PHD research on procedurally modeling buildings, the aforementioned Pascal Mueller went on to create [CityEngine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityEngine#Software), a city generation tool that has dominated the procedural generation landscape. While he has published more architecture-related papers, the majority of his methods remain closed-source. The software is built around generating cities, serializing the data, and porting it to standard enterprise software like 3ds Max or Houdini.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to make a system similar to CityEngine, but optimize it to the point that it can generate cities in real-time. I also want to finish my original goal - to make complex, interesting buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I will do this is by incrementally editing a buildings facade as it is built higher. I have spent much time on google maps studying the architecture of scyscrapers, and the vast majority of them have multiple \"wedding-cake\" style layers. The way I will do this is with a CSP and state machine working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPLEMENTATION - CSP\n",
    "\n",
    "*variables*: An operation that modifies a building.\n",
    "\n",
    "*domains*: The order and selection of creation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*constraints*: The structural rules of the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did I choose CSP?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "REASON 1 - optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "If I really want to make this process optimized enough to run in real-time, GOFAI techniques are useful. They have very predictable runtimes. They can be more easily controlled, as opposed to say a neural network, which has very \"foggy\" implementations that are not easily observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "REASON 2 - reproduceability\n",
    "\n",
    "Every graph search of this algorithm uses a pseudo-random seed. This means that I can re-make the building any time I want if I store the seed number. This becomes useful when creating large worlds. If a player travels far enough away from a building, it is deleted to save framerate and provide ram space for other buildings generated closer to the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prototype\n",
    "\n",
    "I have created a sort of lab for playing around with the algorithm. The user can draw the outline of the building, and hit a button to generate it. There is an option to change the seed or use a random one. There is a button to change from daytime and night time. There is a button to redraw the outline. The user can move his/her camera around a flat grid plane.\n",

    "\n",
    "I have about four operations at the moment that are built into the state machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "*curved* - does a quadratic curve operation of the corners of the building\n",
    "\n",
    "*grow* - grows the outline of the building. Used to create that \"near-future\" feeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*shrink* - shrinks the outline of the building. Uses the \"layer-cake\" model of many skyscrapers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*extrude* - creates a wall from the working outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state machine only allows for walls to be curved at the beginning of the generation process. This prevents curving the building multiple times and creating unneccessary geometry.\n",

    "Not all buildings are as pretty as these, but here are some of my favorites.\n",
