    "# City Architect - Report\n",
    "Author: Andrew Quist  |  Class: CS 344  |  Calvin College  |  Professor: Keith Van der Linden\n",

    "# Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest distinction between many cities is their signature architectural styles. Chicago has modern glass megaliths standing beside turn-of-the-century clock towers. Tokyo has unending rows of neon signs. Madrid is a spider web of cobbled streets and stone facades. The more cities I visit, the more intrigue I have for them. Lately I've been working methods to programmatically create my own cities. This is why I want to make an AI architect for my final project, implementing sufficiently optimized GOFAI principles. Paired with the right genre (in this case, near-future science fiction), this would make a compelling environment for storytelling and gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural generation is a growing technique in the entertainment industry. Used extensively in games like [No Man's Sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Man%27s_Sky) and [Sir, You are Being Hunted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir,_You_Are_Being_Hunted), procedural generation is used to generate large and unique environments for player exploration. While these techniques are typically used for terrain and vegetation, they can be applied to any type of environment. This is an exciting new frontier in interactive mediums, and is constantly being used in creative new ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone interested in cities, I would like to make an algorithm that designs large, scalable downtown environments. I have spent the past year making tools to generate complex 3d shapes, and the past two months have been dedicated to using these tools to generate roads and intersections. My platform of choice is [Unity](https://unity.com/): a game engine that is deceptively simple and powerfully complex. Now comes the fun part - architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most cited article for procedural city generation is Parish and Muller's paper titled [Procedural Modeling of Cities](https://cgl.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf). Many developers in the procedural generation community claim it to be the golden standard of city generation techniques, while others pan it as unnecessarily obfuscated. Most agree, however, that Parish and Muller were ahead of their time. This paper implements a mathematical model called L-systems to recreate the organic nature of road maps. Their focus is mainly on roads and intersections in this paper, but they do talk about placing and generating buildings. However, their model is simplistic, generating boxy, rectangular buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "After writing his PHD research on procedurally modeling buildings, the aforementioned Pascal Mueller went on to create [CityEngine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CityEngine#Software), a city generation tool that has dominated the procedural generation landscape. While he has published [more architecture-related papers](http://peterwonka.net/Publications/pdfs/2006.SG.Mueller.ProceduralModelingOfBuildings.final.pdf), the majority of his methods remain closed-source. The software is built around generating cities, serializing the data, and porting it to standard enterprise software like 3ds Max or Houdini.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal is to make a system similar to CityEngine, but optimize it to the point that it can generate cities in real-time. I also want to finish my original goal - to make complex, interesting buildings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way I will do this is by incrementally editing a buildings facade as it is built higher. I have spent much time on google maps studying the architecture of scyscrapers, and the vast majority of them have multiple \"wedding-cake\" style layers. The way I will do this is with a CSP and state machine working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Parish and Muller use a form of language-based string concatenations to generate roadmaps. I used a form of language-based string concatenations to generate buildings. These strings are interpreted as variables, and are mapped to domains and constraints like a typical CSP problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the N-Queens problems we did in class, the system chooses a candidate for the solution. This candidate is then modified until all constraints are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the CSP, I used a directed graph search to increase the complexity of the model. Traversal of this graph is what generates the variables. If the candidate is rejected, the graph is re-traversed to avoid this rejection. The graph also enforces langage syntax: variables must follow in the order that they can be fed into the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## variables\n",
    "\n",
    "-extrude: creates walls of building\n",
    "\n",
    "-curve: gives building curved walls via building outline\n",
    "\n",
    "-bevel: adds diagonal cut to building corners\n",
    "\n",
    "-inset: adds a square inset to building outline\n",
    "\n",
    "-outset: adds a square outset to building outline\n",
    "\n",
    "-grow: inflates the outline of the building\n",
    "\n",
    "-shrink: deflates the outline of the building\n",
    "\n",
    "## domians\n",
    "\n",
    "-The order in which the variables are fed into the builder class (to construct the building from bottom up)\n",
    "\n",
    "## constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "-the building's outline cannot grow past its outline on the ground, but it can in above-ground extrusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-any additive or subtractive outline operation (shrink, grow, outset, inset) is not allowed if it causes an outline to overlap itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "-any operation forbidden by the stylistic guidelines (controlled by user) is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "-a building that has been curved before cannot be curved again.\n",
    "\n",
    "-a building that is beveled cannot be beveled again.\n",
    "\n",
    "-a building can only be extruded N times, where N is a building's maximum complexity (chosen at random via seed).\n",
    "\n",
    "## language\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all languages, these variables have a convention. each \"sentence\" (a proposed model) begins with 'start' and ends with 'finished'. Here's a representation of the state machine that the system uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewmanq/cs344/master/project/submission/scripts/pictures_v2/StateMachineImage.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph ensures that every modification follows an extrusion. It also enables the choosing of a different modification if the first modification was rejected. It encourages modifying a building multiple times before extruding again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This graph traversal method also helps with reproduceability. Tying each traversal with a seed makes each unique building endtirely reproduceable at a moment's notice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why did I choose CSP?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "REASON 1 - optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "If I really want to make this process optimized enough to run in real-time, GOFAI techniques are useful. They have very predictable runtimes. They can be more easily controlled, as opposed to say a neural network, which has very \"foggy\" implementations that are not easily observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "REASON 2 - reproduceability\n",
    "\n",
    "Every graph search of this algorithm uses a pseudo-random seed. This means that I can re-make the building any time I want if I store the seed number. This becomes useful when creating large worlds. If a player travels far enough away from a building, it is deleted to save framerate and provide ram space for other buildings generated closer to the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown below is my program's interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewmanq/cs344/master/project/submission/scripts/pictures_v2/interface.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the left, the user can choose to ban any of the operations, resulting in a stylistic difference in building creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'generate' button creates the building based on user specifications (seed number and style guidelines).\n",
    "\n",
    "The button on the bottom left allows the user to re-draw the building's outline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The button on the top right changes the time of day in the display environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously stated, my goal was to make varied, interesting, and complex buildings. I think I have succeeded. Below are some examples of buildings generated with this algorithm:\n",

    "# Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "I posted an early screenshot of this program to a forum that was dedicated to fictional/imaginary architecture. While most feedback was positive, there were a few concerns. An interesting response was this one:\n",
    "\n",
    "> USER1: *Oh god this is genuinely anxiety inducing to think about since I'm studying to be an architectural designer*\n",
    "\n",
    "Another user responded to this comment:\n",
    "\n",
    ">> USER2: *graduating next week. we have conversations about robot architect (hopefully you will/do too) . i can see it happening,. alot of people think there is too much 'art', but idk man*\n",
    "\n",
    "The original poster responded:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> USER1: *Ah nice man yeah at my school they've been saying that I have nothing to worry about when it comes to the design but this whipped out a really interesting shape and layout so that gets me on edge. Also congrats! hope all goes well*\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing that this was a purely cosmetic implementation, I laughed at these notions at first. *It's not like I'm generating full interiors! I can hardly get exteriors to work correctly,* I said to myself. However, there is some validity to these architect's concerns. For example, my program can quickly iterate through building models. This would be useful to a client looking for a new building but not knowing exactly what it should look like. Traditionally, an archictect would draw out drafts and proposals. What happens if a machine starts to encroach on 'creative' aspects of prototyping?\n",
    "\n",
    "As a one-person project, this designer is nothing more than a gimmick. However, if it were an enterprise solution made by several people, who is to say whether it could take an architect's position? Obvously, at this point an architect would produce the best results. On the other hand, not every company wants to spend money to pay an expert architect.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know the answers, but this was quite an interesting revelation to stumble upon in the design-oriented corner of the internet."
