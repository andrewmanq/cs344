# the AI architect

## vision

I made an AI that designs buildings with pseudo-random number generation, state machines, and GOFAI implementations. Each layer of complexity makes the algorithm more varied and convincing. Created with the Unity API and engine tools.

[Full report](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/blob/master/project/submission/report.ipynb) - details the methods and implementations of the AI architect.

[Demo](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/tree/master/project/submission/demo) - download this file and run CityGen3.exe on a windows computer to see the AI in action (make sure to use a good computer!).

[Full project files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Se49eI0XO4tce00GX-V9KFWy9q1mP2AG?usp=sharing) - can be run on Unity version 2018.3.8 or above. This is a large download.

## scripts

[state machine code](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/blob/master/project/submission/scripts/StateMachines.cs) - the abstract state machine class I programmed specifically for this system.

[builder class](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/blob/master/project/submission/scripts/builder.cs) - the script that implements StateMachines.cs for CSP problem solving. Also creates the buildings themselves.

[mathematical operations](https://github.com/andrewmanq/cs344/blob/master/project/submission/scripts/vecOps.cs) - the utility functions that builder.cs uses for bulding facades.

[mesh tools](https://github.com/andrewmanq/UnityMeshTools) - the dna of this project. A concoction of mine that took several months.

enjoy!
