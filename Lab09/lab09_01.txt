    a. How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?

While it does work to decrease RMSE, the linear regressor still soars above the 400s which is not a good sign.

    b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.

L2 loss 

    c. Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.
    d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.
