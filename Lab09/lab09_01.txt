Questions:

    a. How does the linear regression approach to the problem fare?

While it does work to decrease RMSE, the linear regressor still soars above the 400s which is not a good sign.

    b. Task 1: Compare and contrast L2 Loss vs LogLoss.

L2 loss adds up the squared difference between targets and predictions. Log loss constrains the normalized 0 to 1 differences that are useful for things like probability.

    c. Task 2: Explain how the logistic regression fares compared to the linear regression.

while the last regression didn't improve much, the logistic regression passed .50

    d. Task 3: Here, just report the best values you can achieve for AUC/accuracy and what hyperparameters you used to get them.

learning rate of 1x10^(4)
3500 steps
500 batch size
