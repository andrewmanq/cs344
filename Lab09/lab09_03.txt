    Exercise 1:
        a. Whatâ€™s the size of the cats/dogs datasets?
        1000 training
        500 validation
        b. How does the first convnet compare with the one we did in class.
        The class example got over .99 percent correct. Compared to .69 from this one, it's a little underwhelming. At the same time, this subject is much more ambiguous than a set of symbols that are designed to be distinguishable from the other ones.
        c. Can you see any interesting patterns in the intermediate representations?
        Outlines seem to be a big deal for these algorithms.
    Exercise 2:
        d. What is data augmentation?
        modifying an existing data set to create more training examples. Example: flipping/scaling an image for recognition,effectively making it a new training example.
        e. Report your best results and the hyperparameters you used to get them.
        steps/epoch - 100
        epochs - 30
        validation steps - 50
        verbose - 2
    You can skip Exercise 3.
