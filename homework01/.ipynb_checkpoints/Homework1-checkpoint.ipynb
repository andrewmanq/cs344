    "Taking Psychology 151, I learned that early psychologists thought really hard about their own thoughts, making assumptions based on their introspections. As it turned out, this provided little to no data on how our brains actually worked. It was through imperical data and rigorous testing that psychology found its true power. Moravec was famous for realizing that easy activities for humans were incredibly hard for AI - things like motor functions, image recognition, and critical thinking. Introspection might make a scientist wrongly come to the conclusion that such things are easy for AI because it was easy for his/her mind to accomplish. Perhaps studying the more concrete science of brains (like axons, neurotransmitters, and general neuron activities) will prove more serious results.\n",
