    a. Compare and contrast Seaborn vs. MatPlotLib.
MatPlotLib is a lightweight graphing library. Seaborn a heavier library for polished data visualization.
    b. How big is this dataset and does it seem of an appropriate size for this problem?
314x9 - It's a few hundred short of what I've been working with in previous excercises, but still a lot. More data is always good in this situation. Compared to housing data, however, it's a lot more visibly correllated.
    c. Explain what the prescribed normalization of the data does.
Normalizing the data boils down the data's units to standard deviations constrained to the range of the data. It makes the values much smaller.
    d. Is this an example of a linear regression model?
Yes - It makes a pattern out of correlated data
    e. In their conclusion, they claim that smaller datasets “prefer” smaller networks. Do you agree? Explain your answer.
