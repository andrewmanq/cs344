Questions:

	a. What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example value from the correlation table you compute and explain why it makes sense.
	
The pearson correlation coefficient is a good gauge of whether a feature is correlated with another feature in a dataset, and to what extent.For instance, total_bedrooms and total_rooms has a strong .9 correlation because buildings with more rooms will likely also havemore bedrooms by definition.

	b.Submit your solutions to tasks 1–2. Include the features you selected for task 1 and the synthetic features you developed for task 2; include the final RMS errors but not the training output. Did you beat the Google-provided baselines?

TASK 1 - I tried 'total rooms' and 'medium income'. Despite having more correlation than the example, I could not find a solid training model that had a reliable RMSE elimination.

minimal_features = [
    "total_rooms",
    "median_income"
]

assert minimal_features, "You must select at least one feature!"

minimal_training_examples = training_examples[minimal_features]
minimal_validation_examples = validation_examples[minimal_features]

#
# Don't forget to adjust these parameters.

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.005,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=9,
    training_examples=minimal_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=minimal_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)

TASK 2

def offset_from_SanFran(source_df):
  selected_examples = pd.DataFrame()
  selected_examples["median_income"] = source_df["median_income"]
  selected_examples["offset_from_san_francisco"] = source_df["latitude"] - 38
  return selected_examples

selected_training_examples = distance_from_SanFran(training_examples)
selected_validation_examples = offset_from_SanFran(validation_examples)

supermodel = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.01,
    steps=700,
    batch_size=5,
    training_examples=selected_training_examples,
    training_targets=training_targets,
    validation_examples=selected_validation_examples,
    validation_targets=validation_targets)
