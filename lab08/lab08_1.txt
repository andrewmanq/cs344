Questions:

	a. What does the Pearson correlation coefficient measure? Identify one example value from the correlation table you compute and explain why it makes sense.
	
		The pearson correlation coefficient is a good gauge of whether a feature is correlated with another feature in a dataset, and to what extent.
		For instance, total_bedrooms and total_rooms has a strong .9 correlation because buildings with more rooms will likely also have
		more bedrooms by definition.

	b.Submit your solutions to tasks 1â€“2. Include the features you selected for task 1 and the synthetic features you developed for task 2; include the final RMS errors but not the training output. Did you beat the Google-provided baselines?
